Open a new Command Prompt window (don’t close the server one)
Then type:

mongosh


If everything’s set up correctly, you’ll see:

Current Mongosh Log ID: ...
Connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/


Now you’re inside MongoDB! 🎉

🟣 Step 3 — Test Basic Commands

Try these commands one by one:

show dbs


→ Shows all databases.

use testDB


→ Switches (or creates) a database named testDB.

db.createCollection("students")


→ Creates a collection (like a table).

db.students.insertOne({ name: "Raghav", course: "Full Stack" })


→ Adds one document.

db.students.find()


→ Displays the data.

🧩 The Databases You See by Default

When you typed:

show dbs


You saw:

admin
config
local


Here’s what they mean:

Database	Purpose
admin	Used for administrative commands (like adding users or managing roles).
config	Stores information about MongoDB’s internal cluster setup (you don’t need to edit it).
local	Keeps local server data such as replication info — not replicated across servers.

✅ These three always exist by default — you didn’t create them.
Now you’ll start creating your own databases (like students, users, products, etc.)

🪄 Pro Tip

If you ever forget:

which database you’re in → db

what collections it has → show collections

what data’s inside → db.collectionName.find()

That’s it! Just those 3 commands help you explore everything you’ve created.
